Loki is a powerful, simple to use library that uses annotations to help you edit them in a GUI.

The intention of this Library is to remove a lot of work that it usually takes to create a GUI Element, in which you can edit values of an object.

Work is usually on hold for this library, unless there are breaking bugs or lack of an obvious feature.

Team Pandora takes care of development of this repository.

## Goals

Current released version is stable and there are no features in the pipelines.
If you have any suggestions/bugs, feel free to share them over [here](https://github.com/HephaistosCorp/Loki/issues/new)!



## HowTo

There is a folder containing an example project where all possible features are implemented. You can check it out over [here](https://github.com/HephaistosCorp/Loki/tree/master/test/Example). You will find every use case for every feature inside of those classes.
